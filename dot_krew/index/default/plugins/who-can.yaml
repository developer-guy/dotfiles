    Shows who has RBAC permissions to access Kubernetes resources
  description: |+2
    Shows which subjects have RBAC permissions to VERB [TYPE | TYPE/NAME | NONRESOURCEURL]

    VERB is a logical Kubernetes API verb like 'get', 'list', 'watch', 'delete', etc.
    TYPE is a Kubernetes resource. Shortcuts and API groups will be resolved, e.g. 'po' or 'pod.metrics.k8s.io'.
    NAME is the name of a particular Kubernetes resource.
    NONRESOURCEURL is a partial URL that starts with "/".

    For example, if you want to find all subjects who have permission to
    delete pods in a particular namespace, or to delete nodes in the cluster
    (dangerous!) you could run the following commands:

    $ kubectl who-can delete pods --namespace foo
    $ kubectl who-can delete nodes

    For usage or examples, run:

    $ kubectl who-can -h
  caveats: |
    The plugin requires the rights to list (Cluster)Role and (Cluster)RoleBindings.
